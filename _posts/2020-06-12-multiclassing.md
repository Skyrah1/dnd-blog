*Disclaimer: I may use “you” to refer to either you as the player, or the PC you take your role as at your table. Please use common sense and don’t actually initiate fights in public by posing and shouting "I have the power of God* and *anime on my side!" at random strangers. Cleric/Monk builds are cool, but you may get arrested for assault and people will make memes of you on the internet (though depending on what you want, this may be a good thing).*

# Introduction

So you're playing D&D with your friends, and maybe on occasion you think to yourself things like *"man, wouldn't if be cool if my Wizard could punch things really hard"*, or *"gee, I wish my Barbarian knew a couple of spells for when I can't just smash everything"*. You might feel limited in terms of what your character can do, and you don't want to be *totally* dependent on the rest of your fellow adventurers in case you need to split the party (DM forbid).

Or maybe you have a really specific character concept in mind, and none of the 12 different classes provided to you (13 if you count the Artificer from *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*) are enough to provide them with the desired skillset. Maybe some events occured during your campaign that presented further roleplaying opportunities, such as your character gaining a deity's favor, loss of a fellow party member, shady dealings with criminals etc.

Or maybe you're just looking to optimize your character to perform some task *really* well.

If any of these are true, then you may have considered **multiclassing** at some point.

### What is "multiclassing"?

For those of you new to the concept, multiclassing is choosing to take a level in another class when you level up, instead the class you already have. To do this, you need to have at least a 13 in the primary stat of your class, as well as the class that you want to multiclass into. Some classes may have more than one stat that need to meet this requirement. In other words, your Wizard needs to be strong enough to learn how to fight, but not so dumb that they can't be anything *but* a Wizard.

Depending on the class chosen, you may gain some of their proficiencies to use skills, weapons and armor. The proficiencies gained are detailed in the SRD. You will also gain access to the features of that class up to 1st level, as well as a subclass of your choice (if applicable at that level).

Furthermore, when you level up again, you can choose if you want to invest a level into your primary class, the class you multiclassed into, or if you want to multiclass *again*.

So for example, if I had a level 3 Barbarian and I wanted to multiclass one level into Paladin, I would need a 13 in Strength to meet the Barbarian's requirements for multiclassing. The Paladin requires the same minimum score in both Strength and Charisma, so my Barbarian would have to be at least somewhat charming and have some self confidence as well. I already have all the proficiencies I would gain from Paladin, as a result of starting as a Barbarian, so the only things I would gain are Divine Sense, Lay On Hands, and a d10 hit die.

If you're really new to D&D and you find this a little confusing, you're not alone. Multiclassing can be surprisingly hard to wrap your head around if you're starting out, so it's a good idea to talk to your DM about it.

# Arguments *for* multiclassing:

### It allows for more character concepts

Multiclassing allows for many different possibilities beyond just sticking to one class. This allows for players to create a multitude of unique and interesting characters.

For example, you may want to play a character torn between two higher powers, serving as a mediator or conspirator between a deity and a demon (Cleric/Warlock). Maybe you want to make a swashbuckling pirate blessed with powers of storms and hurricanes, tagging enemies with your rapier before blasting them with lightning (Rogue/Sorcerer). Maybe you want to play as a mechanic/engineer type of character, who goes berserk when either one of his beloved contraptions is destroyed or if someone is factually incorrect during a conversation, which triggers his nerd-Rage (Artificer/Barbarian).

As long as your fellow players and DM are alright with your character concept, you can play just about anything with enough creativity.

### It can be optimal (done right)

Another reason some players choose to multiclass is to make their characters stronger in a particular aspect. For instance, [one player theorycrafted a Wizard/Warlock build that deals an absurd amount of damage with Magic Missile](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/9lhgmy/insane_build_the_nuclear_wizard/). This is a bit of an extreme example and in most cases, this kind of power isn't needed, but in some campaigns the difficulty of encounters is so high that it feels almost required for the smallest chance of survival.

Some other players may also want to branch out to fill a role that they feel is missing from their party. Perhaps they feel that they're missing frontline fighters, so the Bard chooses to multiclass into Paladin. Or the party might need more support and battlefield control, so the Monk may multiclass into Druid (note that this also gives them the opportunity to play as Po from *Kung Fu Panda*).

### It can be *really fun*

The number one reason why anyone should do anything in a game, is that **it's fun for everyone involved**.

For me, there's just something really cool about building and playing multiclassed characters. I like the process of theorycrafting strong but slightly unconventional builds because it makes my character feel a little more personal. I enjoy imagining different "routes" that my character might take depending on the storyline, and thinking about different potential multiclassing builds based on those routes.

Playing with someone else that multiclasses can also be fun, because it gives your characters something to talk about to each other in an RP-heavy game. Why did they choose to branch out? What shady background does the Ranger have that they know Thieves' Cant? This admittedly will be more dependent on how good you are at writing your characters in general, but I believe multiclassing can potentially be used as a tool for enhancing the roleplaying experience for everyone involved.

# Arguments *against* multiclassing

### Sometimes it's unnecessary

Many people would argue that multiclassing isn't needed to build a particular kind of character.

For instance, imagine you wanted to make a character that either follows or is inspired by Thor (the *Marvel* variant, anyway).

One possible way you could build them is as a Tempest Cleric/Eldritch Knight. Tempest Cleric gains access to devastating thunder and lightning spells, whereas Eldritch Knight makes them a better melee combatant and lets them summon their weapon to themselves.

But there are other possible single-class builds that you could go for. A straight Tempest Cleric or a straight Eldritch Knight would qualify, though they would be more focused on spellcasting and melee combat respectively. Storm Herald Barbarians can also fit the theme of lightning and hammers. Paladins don't get much thunder damage, but their radiant-based Smites can be reflavored to lightning strikes, and they can both fight and cast spells as well. Heck, a Bard could grab a light hammer or a reflavored mace and a couple of lightning spells with Magical Secrets, and they'd probably fit the role perfectly since Bards can do just about anything.

### It can be sub-optimal (done wrong)

If you don't know what you're doing with multiclassing, there is a fair chance your character won't perform as well as the rest of your party. Fortunately, 5e is forgiving in that sense, as you'd need to be *really* trying to build a character that can't do anything.

It's common wisdom to avoid multiclassing until after your character reaches level 5, as that's when classes get either Extra Attack (doubling weapon damage per round) or 3rd level spells (greatly increasing power and versatility). The difference between a 4th level character and a 5th level character is quite high, and sacrificing that boost in power for the benefits of another class could potentially hurt your character more than it's worth.

Of course, this might not be an issue to you if you're sure about what you want and are willing to make that sacrifice, or if you don't care as much about how mechanically effective you are compared to the rest of your party, so long as you're having fun.

### It can be *really complicated*

If you thought the basic multiclassing rules were confusing enough, then good news! *It gets worse.*

What about multiclassing spellcasters? What kind of spells can your character use? How many spell slots do they have? What about if they're multiclassing into/from Warlock? How does Unarmored Defense interact with Wild Shape? Can you use both Smite and a Superiority Die on a single attack? How many Channel Divinities does a Paladin/Cleric have? How does Action Surge work with spellcasting?

These are just some questions that might arise from multiclassing. Thankfully, a quick web search and/or [a visit to Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu) should be enough to provide a satisfying answer. That being said, you need to consult your DM about how they would rule it to make sure both of you are on the same page when it comes up. They may rule things differently, so it's important to understand their reasoning and what this means for your character build.

# Conclusion

Choosing whether you want to multiclass can be a tough decision. It's important to know what you're willing to sacrifice, and what you're actually gaining in return. Above all else, make sure everyone is having fun (yourself included)!
